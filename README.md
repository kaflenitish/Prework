## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The #1 challenge that I encountered when building the app was get to know the XCode environment itself. 
I also encountered challenge to get navigation controller to work.
Moreover, following instruction and using variable such as bill, or tipPercentages showed error. Adding _ after the variable, such as 'bill_ = ... ' worked for me.
